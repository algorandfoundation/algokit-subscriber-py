title: Low Latency Processing
description: Control polling frequency and use algod block waiting for near-instant transaction processing.
---

You can control the polling semantics of the library when using the [`AlgorandSubscriber`](../../guide/subscriber/) by either specifying the `frequency_in_seconds` parameter to control the duration between polls or you can use the `wait_for_block_when_at_tip` parameter to indicate the subscriber should [call algod to ask it to inform the subscriber when a new round is available](https://dev.algorand.co/reference/rest-apis/algod/#waitforblock) so the subscriber can immediately process that round with a much lower-latency.

When `wait_for_block_when_at_tip` is set, the subscriber intelligently uses this option only when it's caught up to the tip of the chain, but otherwise uses `frequency_in_seconds` while catching up.

```python
import algokit_subscriber as sub

# When catching up: polls every 1s for the next 1000 blocks.
# When at tip: calls algod to wait for a new block for near-instant processing.
subscriber = sub.AlgorandSubscriber(
    config=sub.AlgorandSubscriberConfig(
        frequency_in_seconds=1,
        wait_for_block_when_at_tip=True,
        max_rounds_to_sync=1000,
        # ... other configuration options
    ),
    # ...
)
subscriber.start()
```

If you are using [`get_subscribed_transactions`](../../guide/subscriptions/) or the `poll_once` method on `AlgorandSubscriber` then you can use your infrastructure and/or surrounding orchestration code to take control of the polling duration.

If you want to manually run code that waits for a given round to become available you can execute the following algosdk code:

```python
algod.status_after_block(round_number_to_wait_for)
```
